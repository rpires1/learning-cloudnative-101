Readiness probes give an application time to catch up and make itself ready again to handle more traffic versus shutting down completely and simply creating a new pod. In most cases, liveness and readiness probes are run together on the same application to make sure that the container has time to get up and running properly as well as stays healthy enough to handle the traffic. "),Object(i.b)("h2",null,"Managed Lifecycle Pattern"),Object(i.b)("p",null,"The Managed Lifecycle pattern describes how containers need to adapt their lifecycles based on the events that are communicated from a managing platform such as Kubernetes.  Containers do not have control of their own lifecycles.  It’s the managing platforms that allow them to live or die, get traffic or have none, etc.  This pattern covers how the different events can affect those lifecycle decisions."),Object(i.b)("h3",null,"SIGTERM"),Object(i.b)("p",null,"The SIGTERM is a signal that is sent from the managing platform to a container or pod that instructs the pod or container to shutdown or restart.  This signal can be sent due to a failed liveness test or a failure inside the container.  SIGKILL allows the container to cleaning and properly shut itself down versus SIGKILL, which we will get to next. Once received, the application will shutdown as quickly as it can, allowing other processes to stop properly and cleaning up other files.  Each application will have a different shutdown time based on the tasks needed to be done."),Object(i.b)("h3",null,"SIGKILL"),Object(i.b)("p",null,"SIGKILL is a signal sent to a container or pod forcing it to shutdown.  A SIGKILL is normally sent after the SIGTERM signal.  There is a default 30 second grace period between the time that SIGTERM is sent to the application and SIGKILL is sent.  The grace period can be adjusted for each pod using the .spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds field. The overall goal for containerized applications should be aimed to have designed and implemented quick startup and shutdown operations."),Object(i.b)("h3",null,"postStart"),Object(i.b)("p",null,"The postStart hook is a command that is run after the creation of a container and begins asynchronously with the container’s primary process. PostStart is put in place in order to give the container time to warm up and check itself during startup.  During the postStart loop the container will be labeled in “pending” mode in kubernetes while running through it’s initial processes.  If the postStart function errors out it will do so with a nonzero exit code and the container process will be killed by Kubernetes.  Careful planning must be done when deciding what logic goes into the postStart function because if it fails the container will also fail to start.
