We are using [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) to define it.\n\n**Jenkins**\n\nJenkins is a popular open source Continuous Integration tool. It is built in Java. It allows the developers to perform continuous integration and build automation. It allows you to define steps and executes them based on the instructions like building the application using build tools like Ant, Gradle, Maven etc, executing shell scripts, running tests etc. All the steps can be executed based on the timing or event. It depends on the setup. It helps to monitor all these steps and sends notifications to the team members in case of failures. Also, it is very flexible and has a large plugin list which one easily add based on their requirements.\n\nCheck these guides out if you want to know more about Jenkins - [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/doc/), Leading open source automation server.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- You need an [IBM cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/login).\n- Create kubernetes cluster using [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-getting-started). Here, you can choose an openshift cluster.\n- Install [oc](https://www.okd.io/download.html) command line tool.\n- You should be familiar with basics like Containers, Docker, Kubernetes.\n\n## Continuous Integration\n\n### Install Jenkins\n\n- Open the IBM Cloud Openshift cluster.\n\n![OC Cluster](../../images/ibmcloud_oc_cluster.png)\n\n- Click on the `OpenShift web console` tab and this will take you to openshift UI.\n\n![OC Cluster](../../images/openshift_console.png)\n\n- Create a new project.\n\n![OC Cluster](../../images/create_project_oc.png)\n\n- Search for `Jenkins`.\n\n![Search Jenkins](../../images/search_jenkins.png)\n\n- Choose `Jenkins (Ephemeral)`.\n\n![OC Cluster](../../images/Jenkins_ephemeral.png)\n\n- Install it.\n\n![OC Cluster](../../images/Jenkins_ephemeral_details_one.png)\n\n![OC Cluster](../../images/Jenkins_ephemeral_details_two.png)\n\n![OC Cluster](../../images/Jenkins_ephemeral_details_three.png)\n\n- Wait till the Jenkins installs and the pods are ready.\n\n![OC Cluster](../../images/Jenkins_oc_url.png)\n\n- Once, it is ready you can access the Jenkins by clicking the link.\n\n![OC Cluster](../../images/Jenkins_oc_login.png)\n\nNow, click on `Log in with OpenShift`.\n\n- When you gets logged in, you will see the below screen.
